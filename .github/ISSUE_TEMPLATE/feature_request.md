## Describe alternatives you've considered
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

## Manufacturing Context
Help us understand how this feature would improve CNC operations:
- **Shop Size**: [e.g. Small (1-5 machines), Medium (6-20 machines), Large (20+ machines)]
- **Machine Types**: [e.g. Mills, Lathes, Routers, Multi-axis]
- **Current Pain Points**: [e.g. Frequent tool breakage, Material waste, Downtime costs]
- **Expected Benefits**: [e.g. Reduce downtime by X%, Prevent Y type of failures]

## Technical Requirements (if applicable)
- **Hardware Integration**: [e.g. Specific camera types, sensors, CNC controllers]
- **Software Integration**: [e.g. CAM software, ERP systems, existing monitoring tools]
- **Performance Requirements**: [e.g. Real-time processing, specific latency needs]
- **Scalability Needs**: [e.g. Number of concurrent streams, data retention]

## User Experience
- **Who would use this feature?**: [e.g. Shop owners, operators, maintenance staff]
- **How often would it be used?**: [e.g. Daily, per job, during setup]
- **Critical vs. Nice-to-have**: [e.g. Must-have for safety, Would improve efficiency]

## Implementation Ideas (optional)
If you have ideas about how this could be implemented:
- **UI/UX suggestions**: [e.g. Dashboard widget, mobile alert, email notification]
- **Technical approach**: [e.g. Machine learning model, computer vision, IoT integration]
- **Third-party integrations**: [e.g. Existing tools or standards to leverage]

## Mockups/Examples (optional)
If applicable, add sketches, mockups, or examples from other systems that demonstrate your idea.

## Business Impact
- **ROI Potential**: [e.g. Cost savings, efficiency gains, risk reduction]
- **Implementation Urgency**: [e.g. High - Safety critical, Medium - Efficiency improvement, Low - Nice to have]
- **Market Demand**: [e.g. Industry trend, customer requests, competitive advantage]
